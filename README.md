## Explanation

For this assignment, I attempted to parse a JSON file containing the average yearly rainfall in the US since 1895. After taking time to make it into an object and loop through the array, I thought it could be fun to represent the data as actual rain. I used each data point, an integer ranging from 25 to 35 inches, to make a bar of a set width. Then, based on the length, I colored it a deeper shade of blue and displayed it a bit longer. Since p5js typically draws downward from the starting coordinate, I created a collection of upside-down blue bars. To simulate rain, I added a few gray circles at the top to be a sort of cloud and some rectangles at the bottom to set the scene. The results are a fun way to visualize the rainfall across the years. Big thanks to the professor for helping me understand JSON loading this assignment!
